### Reflections and learnings

 - Promise.All
 - Vue component structure
 - using Vue lifecycle hooks
 - Conditional rendering in Vue
 - state management in Vue - state as function interesting
 - styling in Vue
 - Grid styling via variables in code over in stylesheet
 - Need to disable eslint on console.errors
 - Accidentally declared a function outside of the methods block and took about 20 mins to figure out - Use comments at the end of the data, mounted, methods, computed blocks during development to easy this.
